# Data protection

Web applications often need to protect data, so that it can be stored in
cookies or other storages. BlackSheep uses [`itsdangerous`](https://pypi.org/project/itsdangerous/) to sign and encrypt
information, for example when storing `claims` obtained from `id_token`s when
using an integration with an identity provider using [OpenID
Connect](../authentication/#oidc), or when handling [session cookies](../sessions/).

## How to handle secrets

Symmetric encryption is used to sign and encrypt information in several
scenarios. This means that BlackSheep applications _need_ secrets to protect
sensitive data in some circumstances. When keys are not specified, they are
generated automatically in memory when the application starts, for best user's
experience.

!!! danger
    This means that keys are <strong>not persisted</strong> when applications
    restart, and not consistent when multiple instances of the same application
    are deployed across regions, or within a same server. This is acceptable during
    local development, but should not be the case in production environments.

To use consistent keys, configure one or more environment variables like the
following:

* APP_SECRET_1="***"
* APP_SECRET_2="***"
* APP_SECRET_3="***"

Keys can be configured in a host environment, or fetched from a dedicated
service such as `AWS Secrets Manager` or `Azure Key Vault` at application
start-up, and configured as environment settings for the application.
<strong>DO NOT</strong> store secrets that are meant to be used in production
under source control.

## Example

```python
from blacksheep.server.dataprotection import get_serializer


serializer = get_serializer(purpose="example")

token = serializer.dumps({"id": 1, "message": "This will be kept secret"})

print(token)

data = serializer.loads(token)

print(data)
```
