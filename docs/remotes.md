The `blacksheep.server.remotes` namespace provides classes and functions to
handle information related to remote proxies and clients.

Web applications in production environments are commonly hosted behind other
kinds of servers, such as Apache, IIS, or NGINX. Proxy servers usually obscure
some of the information of the original web request before it reaches the web
applications.

For example:

* when HTTPS requests are proxied over HTTP, the original scheme (HTTPS) is
  lost and must be forwarded in a header.
* when an app receives a request from a proxy and not its true source, the
  original client IP address must also be forwarded in a header.
* the *path* of web requests can be changed while being proxied (e.g. NGINX
  configured to proxy requests to `/example` to the root `/` of a web
  application)

This information may be important in request processing, for example in
redirects, authentication, link generation when absolute URLs are needed, and
client geolocation.

This page documents how to configure BlackSheep to work with proxy servers and
load balancers, using provided classes to handle:

- [X] X-Forwarded headers
- [X] Forwarded header
- [X] Trusted hosts
- [X] How to read information about the original clients in web requests

## Handling X-Forwarded headers
`X-Forwarded` headers are the _de-facto_ standard headers to propagate
information about original web requests to web applications.

| Header            | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X-Forwarded-For   | Used to identify the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer. |
| X-Forwarded-Host  | Used to identify the original host requested by the client in the Host HTTP request header                                   |
| X-Forwarded-Proto | Used to identify the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that a client used to connect to your proxy or load balancer.                  |

BlackSheep provides a `XForwardedHeadersMiddleware` class to handle these
headers, providing:

* optional validation of trusted hosts
* optional validation of proxies cound and IP addresses by known IPs or known
  networks

To configure a BlackSheep web application to handle `X-Forwarded` headers and
configure incoming web requests to expose the correct information about source
protocol, client IP, and host:

```python
from blacksheep import Application
from blacksheep.server.remotes.forwarding import XForwardedHeadersMiddleware


app = Application()


@app.on_middlewares_configuration
def configure_forwarded_headers(app):
    app.middlewares.insert(
        0,
        XForwardedHeadersMiddleware(),
    )
```

Options of the `XForwardedHeadersMiddleware` class:

| Parameter      | Type, default                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| allowed_hosts  | Optional[Sequence[str]] = None       | Sequence of allowed hosts. If configured, requests that send a different host in the `Host` header or `X-Forwarded-Host` header are replied with Bad Request.                    |
| known_proxies  | Optional[Sequence[IPAddress]] = None | Sequence of allowed proxies IP addresses. If configured, requests that send different proxies IPs in the request scope or `X-Forwarded-For` header are replied with Bad Request. |
| known_networks | Optional[Sequence[IPNetwork]] = None | Sequence of allowed proxies networks. If configured, requests that send a foreign proxy IP in the request scope or `X-Forwarded-For` header are replied with Bad Request.        |
| forward_limit  | int = 1                              | Maximum number of allowed forwards, by default 1.                                                                                                                                |

When `known_proxies` is not provided, it is set by default to handle `localhost`:
`[ip_address("127.0.0.1")]`.

## Handling Forwarded header
The `Forwarded` header is a standard header to propagate information about
original web requests to web applications.

To configure a BlackSheep web application to handle `Forwarded` headers:


```python
from blacksheep import Application
from blacksheep.server.remotes.forwarding import ForwardedHeadersMiddleware


app = Application()


@app.on_middlewares_configuration
def configure_forwarded_headers(app):
    app.middlewares.insert(
        0,
        ForwardedHeadersMiddleware(),
    )
```

Options of the `ForwardedHeadersMiddleware` class:

| Parameter      | Type, default                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| allowed_hosts  | Optional[Sequence[str]] = None       | Sequence of allowed hosts. If configured, requests that send a different host in the `Host` header or `Forwarded` header are replied with Bad Request.                     |
| known_proxies  | Optional[Sequence[IPAddress]] = None | Sequence of allowed proxies IP addresses. If configured, requests that send different proxies IPs in the request scope or `Forwarded` header are replied with Bad Request. |
| known_networks | Optional[Sequence[IPNetwork]] = None | Sequence of allowed proxies networks. If configured, requests that send a foreign proxy IP in the request scope or `Forwarded` header are replied with Bad Request.        |
| forward_limit  | int = 1                              | Maximum number of allowed forwards, by default 1.                                                                                                                          |

When `known_proxies` is not provided, it is set by default to handle `localhost`:
`[ip_address("127.0.0.1")]`.

## Handling trusted hosts
When forwarded headers middlewares are not used, but it is necessary to
validated hosts, it is possible to use the `TrustedHostsMiddleware`:

```python
from blacksheep import Application
from blacksheep.server.remotes.hosts import TrustedHostsMiddleware


app = Application()


@app.on_middlewares_configuration
def configure_forwarded_headers(app):
    app.middlewares.insert(
        0,
        TrustedHostsMiddleware(["www.neoteroi.dev"]),
    )
```

## Reading information about the original clients in web requests
Web requests expose information about the original clients in the following
properties, that are updated by forwarded header middlewares:

```python
from blacksheep import Request

request: Request

request.host
request.scheme
request.original_client_ip

```

| Property           | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host               | Originating host.                                                                                       |
| scheme             | Originating scheme ("http" or "https").                                                                 |
| original_client_ip | Originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer. |

## Obtaining the web request absolute URL
To obtain the original absolute URL of a web request, use the provided
`get_absolute_url_to_path` and `get_request_absolute_url` functions:

```python
from blacksheep.messages import get_absolute_url_to_path, get_request_absolute_url


# examples
absolute_url = get_request_absolute_url(request)

absolute_url_to_path = get_absolute_url_to_path(request, "/example")
```

!!! warning
    When configuring [OpenID Connect](../authentication/#oidc) authentication,
    it can be necessary to handle forward headers, so that the application can
    generate correct `redirect_uri` for authorization servers.
