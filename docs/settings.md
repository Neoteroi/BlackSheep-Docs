While _most_ settings are described in sections that are dedicated to other
topics, this page describes other settings that can be used in BlackSheep.

## Configuring JSON settings
Since version `1.0.9`, BlackSheep supports configuring the functions that are
used for JSON serialization and deserialization in the web framework.

By default, the built-in `json` module is used for serializing and
deserializing objects, but this can be changed in the way illustrated below.

```python
from blacksheep.plugins import json


def custom_loads(value):
    """
    This function is responsible of parsing JSON into instances of objects.
    """


def custom_dumps(value):
    """
    This function is responsible of creating JSON representations of objects.
    """


json.use(
    loads=custom_loads,
    dumps=custom_dumps,
)
```

!!! info
    BlackSheep uses by default a friendlier handling of `json.dumps`
    that supports serialization of common objects such as `UUID`, `date`,
    `datetime`, `bytes`, `@dataclass`, `pydantic` models, etc.

### Example: using orjson

To use [`orjson`](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) for JSON serialization and
deserialization with the built-in [`responses`](../responses/) and
`JSONContent` class, it can be configured this way:

```python
import orjson

from blacksheep.plugins import json


def serialize(value) -> str:
    return orjson.dumps(value).decode("utf8")


json.use(
    loads=orjson.loads,
    dumps=serialize,
)

```

**Note:** the `decode("utf8")` call is required when configuring `orjson` for
the built-in `responses` functions and the `JSONContent` class. This is because
`orjson.dumps` function returns `bytes` instead of `str`, and this is something
specific to `orjson` implementation, different than the behavior of the
built-in `json` package and other libraries like `rapidjson`, `UltraJSON`, and
`fast-json`. The API implemented in `blacksheep` expects a JSON serialize
function that returns a `str` like in the built-in package.

For users using `orjson` who want to achieve the best performance and avoid the
fee of the superfluous `decode -> encode` passage, it is recommended to:

* not use the built-in `responses` functions and the built-in `JSONContent`
  class
* use a custom defined function for JSON responses like the following example:

```python
def my_json(data: Any, status: int = 200) -> Response:
    """
    Returns a response with application/json content,
    and given status (default HTTP 200 OK).
    """
    return Response(
        status,
        None,
        Content(
            b"application/json",
            orjson.dumps(data),
        ),
    )
```

### Example: applying transformations during JSON operations
The example below illustrates how to apply transformations to objects while
they are serialized and deserialized. Beware that the example only illustrates
this possibility, it doesn't handle objects inside lists, `@dataclass`, or
`pydantic` models!

```python
import json
from typing import Any

from blacksheep.plugins import json as json_plugin
from essentials.json import dumps


def default_json_dumps(obj):
    return dumps(obj, separators=(",", ":"))


def custom_loads(value: str) -> Any:
    # example: applies a transformation when deserializing an object from JSON
    # this can be used for example to change property names upon deserialization

    obj = json.loads(value)

    if isinstance(obj, dict) and "@" in obj:
        obj["modified_key"] = obj["@"]
        del obj["@"]

    return obj


def custom_dumps(value: Any) -> str:
    # example: applies a transformation when serializing an object into JSON
    # this can be used for example to change property names upon serialization

    if isinstance(value, dict) and "@" in value:
        value["modified_key"] = value["@"]
        del value["@"]

    return default_json_dumps(value)


json_plugin.use(
    loads=custom_loads,
    dumps=custom_dumps,
)
```
