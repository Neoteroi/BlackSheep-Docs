# Middlewares

A BlackSheep application supports middlewares, which provide a flexible way to
define a chain of functions that handles every web requests.

## Introduction to middlewares

Middlewares enable the definition of callbacks that are executed for each web
request in a specific order.

!!! info
    When a function should be called only for certain routes, use
    instead a [decorator function](../middlewares/#wrapping-request-handlers).

Middlewares are called in order: each receives the `Request` object as first
parameter, and the next handler to be called as second parameter. Any
middleware can decide to not call the next handler, and return a `Response`
object instead. For example, a middleware can be used to return an `HTTP 401
Unauthorized` response in certain scenarios.

```python
from blacksheep.server import Application
from blacksheep.server.responses import text

app = Application(show_error_details=True)
get = app.router.get


async def middleware_one(request, handler):
    print("middleware one: A")
    response = await handler(request)
    print("middleware one: B")
    return response


async def middleware_two(request, handler):
    print("middleware two: C")
    response = await handler(request)
    print("middleware two: D")
    return response


app.middlewares.append(middleware_one)
app.middlewares.append(middleware_two)


@get("/")
def home():
    return "OK"

```

In this example, the following data would be printed to console:
```
middleware one: A
middleware two: C
middleware two: D
middleware one: B
```

### Middlewares defined as classes

To define a middleware as a class, make the class async callable, like in the
example below:

```python
class ExampleMiddleware:
    async def __call__(self, request, handler):
        # do something before passing the request to the next handler

        response = await handler(request)

        # do something after the following request handlers prepared the response
        return response
```

The same example including type annotations:

```python
from typing import Awaitable, Callable

from blacksheep.messages import Request, Response


class ExampleMiddleware:
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request, handler: Callable[[Request], Awaitable[Response]]
    ) -> Response:
        # do something before passing the request to the next handler

        response = await handler(request)

        # do something after the following request handlers prepared the response
        return response
```

### Resolution chains
When middlewares are defined for an application, resolution chains are built at
its start. Every handler configured in the application router is replaced by a
chain, executing middlewares in order, down to the registered handler.

## Wrapping request handlers

When a common portion of logic should be applied to certain request handlers,
but not to all of them, it is recommended to define a decorator.

The following example shows how to define a decorator that applies certain
response headers only for certain routes.

```python
from functools import wraps
from typing import Tuple

from blacksheep.server.normalization import ensure_response


def headers(additional_headers: Tuple[Tuple[str, str], ...]):
    def decorator(next_handler):
        @wraps(next_handler)
        async def wrapped(*args, **kwargs) -> Response:
            response = ensure_response(await next_handler(*args, **kwargs))

            for (name, value) in additional_headers:
                response.add_header(name.encode(), value.encode())

            return response

        return wrapped

    return decorator
```

Then use the decorator on specific request handlers:

```python
@get("/")
@headers((("X-Foo", "Foo"),))
async def home():
    return "OK"
```

**The order of decorators matters**: user defined decorators must be applied
before the route decorator (before `@get` in the example above).

### Define a wrapper compatible with synchronous and asynchronous functions

To define a wrapper that is compatible with both synchronous and asynchronous
functions, it is possible to use `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` function. For
example, to alter the decorator above to be compatible with request handlers
defined as synchronous functions (recommended):

```python
import inspect
from functools import wraps
from typing import Tuple

from blacksheep.server.normalization import ensure_response


def headers(additional_headers: Tuple[Tuple[str, str], ...]):
    def decorator(next_handler):

        if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(next_handler):
            @wraps(next_handler)
            async def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
                response = ensure_response(await next_handler(*args, **kwargs))

                for (name, value) in additional_headers:
                    response.add_header(name.encode(), value.encode())

                return response

            return wrapped
        else:
            @wraps(next_handler)
            def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
                response = ensure_response(next_handler(*args, **kwargs))

                for (name, value) in additional_headers:
                    response.add_header(name.encode(), value.encode())

                return response

            return wrapped

    return decorator
```

!!! warning
    The `ensure_response` function is necessary to support scenarios
    when the request handlers defined by the user doesn't return an instance of
    Response class (see _[request handlers normalization](../request-handlers/)_).
