The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS)
is a standard feature used to instruct clients that a site should only be
accessed using HTTPS, and any attempt to access it using HTTP should be
converted automatically to HTTPS.

BlackSheep offers a middleware to configure HTTP Strict-Transport-Security
response header globally. This page explains how to use the built-in middleware
to enforce HSTS on a web application.

## Enabling HSTS

```python
from blacksheep import Application
from blacksheep.server.env import is_development
from blacksheep.server.security.hsts import HSTSMiddleware

app = Application()


if not is_development():
    app.middlewares.append(HSTSMiddleware())
```

!!! tip "Considerations for local development"
    It is generally undesirable enabling `HSTS` during local development, since
    browsers get instructed to require `HTTPS` for all traffic on `localhost`.
    This is why the example above configures the middleware only if the
    application is not running for development.
    See [_Defining application environment_](/blacksheep/settings/#defining-application-environment)
    for more information.
