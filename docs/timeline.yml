- title: The work on V2 starts
  sub_title: 2022-Q3
  icon: ':material-rocket-launch-outline:'
  content: >
    The work on the second version of the web framework starts.
    The documentation site is modified to host the documentation for
    v1 and the current actively developed version of the system.
- title: SSR Refactoring
  content: >
    The integration with `Jinja2` is modified to support different
    libraries to achieve server side rendering (SSR). `Jinja2` becomes
    an optional dependency, and handling of `view` and `view_async`
    is improved considerably.
- title: Library Simplification
  content: >
    The HTTP Client will be removed, and the library will be simplified.
    At the beginning, `blacksheep` implemented both an HTTP server and
    and HTTP client. The classes used to handle web requests are
    bidirectional: the `Request` and `Response` classes are the same both for incoming
    requests and outgoing web requests and responses. Even though this is arguably a
    good principle, it constitutes a great complication for the code.
    Version 2.x of the framework drops the HTTP Client and removes the complexity to
    support bidirectional flows.
- title: Configuration Strategy
  content: >
    The framework will provide a strategy to handle application settings.
- title: DI Refactoring
  icon: ':octicons-question-16:'
  content: >
    _Under consideration:_ the integration with `rodi` might be modified
    to support different libraries to achieve dependency injection (DI).
    `rodi` might become an optional dependency.
- title: Name Change
  icon: ':octicons-question-16:'
  content: >
    _Under consideration:_ the web framework might be renamed, to have a more abstract
    name and to adopt a more consistent naming convention across the libraries.
- title: Application Builder
  icon: ':octicons-question-16:'
  content: >
    _Under consideration:_ the _Builder pattern_ might be adopted to simplify the
    `Application` class. In such scenario, an `ApplicationBuilder` class would be used
    to configure the application, and an instance of the application would be obtained
    through it.
